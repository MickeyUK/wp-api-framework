# WordPress API Framework

A simple API plugin for WordPress, that serves more as a framework for those
wanting to craft their own RESTful API service.

The plugin has 2 endpoints set up; one for authenticating users and one for
posting to the blog. Access to these and endpoints you add can be
toggled easily through the plugin's settings page. Endpoints can also be marked
as secure, requiring a JSON Web Token for authorization.
